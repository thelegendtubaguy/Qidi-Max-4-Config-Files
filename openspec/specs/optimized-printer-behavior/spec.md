# optimized-printer-behavior Specification

## Purpose

Optimized printer behavior shortens print transitions while preserving QIDI motion safety, slicer compatibility, hardware monitoring, and vendor-owned QIDI Box behavior.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Guarded motion and calibration optimization
Optimized configuration SHALL reduce homing, probing, mesh, and filament-transition overhead only where the selected firmware baseline or valid installer state proves the change safe.

#### Scenario: Recognized state receives optimized behavior
- **WHEN** supported stock or proven prior-managed motion and timing inputs are installed
- **THEN** guarded values and firmware-scoped payloads from `installer/package.yaml` are applied
- **AND** unrecognized live values are preserved as user-modified
- **AND** production payloads remain syntax-valid and exclude diagnostic-only commands

#### Scenario: Closed-loop homing safety remains intact
- **WHEN** X or Y homes
- **THEN** QIDI controller ordering, two-strike validation, retry/error handling, synchronization behavior for the selected firmware, and final backoff remain active
- **AND** reduced waits and speeds do not add firmware behavior absent from that baseline

#### Scenario: Homing and print preparation avoid redundant motion
- **WHEN** full, per-axis, or lazy homing and print preparation run
- **THEN** normal homing performs the requested axes, lazy homing skips requested axes already known, and Z homes required unknown X/Y first
- **AND** temporary motion settings are restored
- **AND** Z tilt and a fresh adaptive mesh run without redundant homing or loading a stale stock mesh

#### Scenario: Runtime Z offset survives preparation
- **WHEN** start G-code captures the saved runtime Z offset
- **THEN** the offset is cleared before homing, tilt, and mesh
- **AND** the captured value is reapplied after configuration save
- **AND** saved fallback is used only when the session has no capture

### Requirement: Controlled slicer start paths
OrcaSlicer and QIDI Studio packs SHALL implement the same functional print-start branches while retaining parser-specific syntax and the ordered invariants in `openspec/contracts/gcode-paths/start-print.path.json`.

#### Scenario: Slicer entrypoints satisfy the path contract
- **WHEN** either slicer pack is validated
- **THEN** its required and forbidden commands, ordering, temperature inputs, selected tool, and parser-specific placeholders satisfy the controlled path contract
- **AND** first-layer temperature and the selected tool are established before front-bed priming

#### Scenario: Proven retained Box filament avoids reload
- **WHEN** Box availability, filament detection, logical mapping, synchronized physical slot, material, and vendor identity all prove retained-filament reuse
- **THEN** vendor loading and rear purge/cleanup actions are skipped
- **AND** common temperature waits, tilt, fresh mesh, offset, and sensor preparation still run

#### Scenario: Fresh Box filament retains vendor ownership
- **WHEN** the Box is enabled and retained reuse is not proven
- **THEN** start delegates feeder, cutter, retry, runout, RFID, and vendor cleaning ownership to the Box stack
- **AND** optimized purge cleanup and collision-safe rear scraping run before common print preparation

#### Scenario: External spool avoids Box-only actions
- **WHEN** the Box is unavailable or disabled
- **THEN** retained Box state is invalidated and Box load or purge actions are not called
- **AND** collision-safe non-extruding rear cleaning runs before common print preparation

#### Scenario: Prime line remains first-layer aware
- **WHEN** common preparation completes
- **THEN** the prime line uses available room ahead of first-layer bounds or a fixed safe fallback
- **AND** nozzle-temperature Z compensation is applied from a known absolute reference after mesh and offset application

### Requirement: Filament and QIDI Box state lifecycle
Optimized macros SHALL keep external-spool runout policy independent from vendor Box recovery, retain filament only when physical Box state is provable, and normalize tool mappings only at safe lifecycle boundaries.

#### Scenario: External runout pause is independently switchable
- **WHEN** automatic external-spool pause is disabled
- **THEN** sensor events and exhausted status remain visible while automatic external pause is suppressed
- **AND** QIDI Box runout, reload, status, and resume remain vendor-controlled
- **AND** the setting returns enabled after Klipper restart

#### Scenario: Retention follows the synchronized physical slot
- **WHEN** normal end-print retention runs with Box filament loaded
- **THEN** retained tool, slot, material, and vendor identity derive from the synchronized physical slot and current mapping
- **AND** unload clears retained state before vendor unload while preserving caller motion and extrusion modes

#### Scenario: Start repairs only missing active mappings
- **WHEN** print start requires active Box mappings
- **THEN** missing or empty active mappings become identity mappings before filament preparation
- **AND** every existing non-empty mapping is preserved
- **AND** non-Box start remains available

#### Scenario: Normal completion restores predictable mappings
- **WHEN** slicer end G-code completes retention or unloading
- **THEN** cooldown begins before existing mappings are normalized to identity
- **AND** missing mappings are created only for active Box slots
- **AND** normalization completes before print-end cleanup

#### Scenario: Interrupted prints preserve operator recovery state
- **WHEN** cancellation, error, power loss, or another interruption bypasses normal slicer end G-code
- **THEN** current tool mappings are not normalized
- **AND** manual mapping reset is permitted only while the printer is idle

### Requirement: Safe print transitions and helpers
Optimized cut, purge, cooldown, cleaning, calibration, and cancellation helpers SHALL preserve caller state, guard optional hardware, and avoid delayed or error-path actions that can affect a subsequent print.

#### Scenario: Cut and cleanup preserve caller state
- **WHEN** optimized cut, purge, chute, chamber, or Box-heater helpers run
- **THEN** motion modes, extrusion modes, and temporary acceleration are restored
- **AND** optional Box objects are called only when available and valid
- **AND** fixed waits are reduced without replacing required motion completion waits

#### Scenario: End-print performs staged cooldown safely
- **WHEN** normal slicer end G-code runs
- **THEN** the toolhead reaches the chute, filament preparation and heater shutdown occur, and staged cooling and wiping complete before print end
- **AND** bed lowering follows the shared slicer rule
- **AND** delayed fan shutdown cannot turn off a fan used by a new or paused print
- **AND** OrcaSlicer may apply configured completion exhaust while QIDI Studio passes zero and omits unsupported indexed completion-air placeholders

#### Scenario: Error cancellation is motion-free
- **WHEN** optimized error cancellation executes
- **THEN** heaters, fans, optional Box heat, pause state, and print state are cleaned up before base cancellation
- **AND** no parking, wiping, or other toolhead motion occurs

#### Scenario: Operator helpers remain guarded and available
- **WHEN** optimized macros load
- **THEN** supported bed-screw, probe-accuracy, Box-temperature, mapping-reset, and startup reporting helpers are available
- **AND** each helper validates required printer state and hardware bounds before acting

### Requirement: Firmware and vendor compatibility surfaces
Optimized configuration SHALL preserve firmware-scoped peripheral ownership, stock integration names, and fan-failure safety while applying guarded hardware optimizations.

#### Scenario: Polar cooler ownership remains firmware-compatible
- **WHEN** firmware uses the direct polar-cooler output
- **THEN** optimized pause and resume do not change its state or recreate removed smart-pin objects
- **AND** existing direct control remains available to approved start, cooling, end, and cancellation paths

#### Scenario: Hotend fan sampling preserves protection
- **WHEN** the supported hotend-fan baseline is installed
- **THEN** the guarded polling interval declared by the package retains sampling margin above measured fan speed
- **AND** fan output, RPM reporting, and zero-RPM shutdown behavior remain unchanged
- **AND** uninstall restores the owned firmware preimage while preserving user drift

#### Scenario: Stock integration surfaces remain intact
- **WHEN** optimized configuration is installed
- **THEN** stock-named macros required by QIDI software remain available
- **AND** the active vendor Box stack and vendor command names are not redefined
- **AND** `config/fluidd.cfg` and unproven externally consumed stock globals remain unmodified
