## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Filament and QIDI Box state lifecycle
Optimized macros SHALL keep external-spool runout policy independent from vendor Box recovery, retain filament only when the saved preference equals `1` and physical Box state is provable, and normalize tool mappings only at safe lifecycle boundaries.

#### Scenario: External runout pause is independently switchable
- **WHEN** automatic external-spool pause is disabled
- **THEN** sensor events and exhausted status remain visible while automatic external pause is suppressed
- **AND** QIDI Box runout, reload, status, and resume remain vendor-controlled
- **AND** the setting returns enabled after Klipper restart

#### Scenario: Absent runtime preference disables retention
- **WHEN** `tltg_keep_loaded_between_prints` is absent from Klipper saved variables or does not equal `1`
- **THEN** normal optimized print completion clears retained-filament state and delegates cutting and unloading to the existing QIDI Box sequence
- **AND** optimized print start does not reuse retained filament

#### Scenario: Retention follows the synchronized physical slot
- **WHEN** `tltg_keep_loaded_between_prints` equals `1`
- **AND** normal end-print retention runs with Box filament loaded
- **THEN** retained tool, slot, material, and vendor identity derive from the synchronized physical slot and current mapping
- **AND** unload clears retained state before vendor unload while preserving caller motion and extrusion modes

#### Scenario: Retention preference is operator-controlled
- **WHEN** the operator saves `1` or `0` to `tltg_keep_loaded_between_prints`
- **THEN** subsequent optimized starts and normal completions respectively enable or disable retention until the saved value changes
- **AND** installation initializes an absent preference to `1` and does not overwrite an existing value

#### Scenario: Start repairs only missing active mappings
- **WHEN** print start requires active Box mappings
- **THEN** missing or empty active mappings become identity mappings before filament preparation
- **AND** every existing non-empty mapping is preserved
- **AND** non-Box start remains available

#### Scenario: Normal completion restores predictable mappings
- **WHEN** slicer end G-code completes retention or unloading
- **THEN** cooldown begins before existing mappings are normalized to identity
- **AND** missing mappings are created only for active Box slots
- **AND** normalization completes before print-end cleanup

#### Scenario: Interrupted prints preserve operator recovery state
- **WHEN** cancellation, error, power loss, or another interruption bypasses normal slicer end G-code
- **THEN** current tool mappings are not normalized
- **AND** manual mapping reset is permitted only while the printer is idle
